This blog is founded on the idea that being able to communicate effectively is one of the most important skills to master. It is also one of the few topics that I, as I have recently discovered out, care deeply about: writing for effective communication It meant first that I need to invest the time to master this craft. I also hope that, at some point in the future, I could help others write with clarity and communicate better.


## Why effective communication is critically important?

Because so much revolve around written communications in our world, the implication of bad communication is tremendous. You can't convince people if they don't understand your point. You can't discuss with them if you don't understand their points. Now imagine that both side missunderstand the others, then everybody is wasting its time.

When bad communication occures rockets explode, politician get elected or worth, brocholly ice cream get created. In other words, this is bad.

On the other hand, when you read "good" writing, you get the point the author is trying to make, you understand how he or she is getting their and you can decide for yourself if the agurments is logically structured and based on sound facts. In other words, if it makes sense to you.

Good writing make me think, bad writing make me struggle. Then I give up on trying to understand the author message.

Please Don't Write Well, Write Clearly

Clear writing saves other people times 


## What is "clear writing" in the context of efficient communication?

While effective communication is the goal, clear writing is the tool to achieve it. Writing in a way that makes it easy for the reader to really understand what the writer is trying to say. When you master clear writing, you can express and support complex ideas, construct arguments and convince the reader.

For me, it is not about writing nice souding sentences with fancy vocabulary. It is about getting the job done, with minimal effort on the part of the reader to get the point. And getting that can requite an extraordinary amount of work from the writer.

Because this blog is focusing on "non-fiction", contents that try to give knowledge to the reader, there is key characteristic of "good writing" that I would consider central:

- Informative: Reading a text should bring some value to me. Because this is highly subjective, it means that the author should thrive to communicate as early as possible what this article is about and what I could get from it.
- Accurate: whenever the author is providing factual information, he/she should have checked them and provide me with sources so that I can check too.
- Clear: trequires minimal from reader effort to understand what points the author is making and how he or she is backing up its argument. The content should have a carefully defined purpose, logical structure and well-constructed sentences and paragraph. Simple words, whenever possible.
- Concise: go to the point, easy to scan if I don't want to read all the content, don't go on tangent that doesn't make the point go forward
- Entertaining: try to make it not only informative, but also interesting to read.

Of course, not all writing fall this category. It is fine to read purely for entertainment and literature don't have to go to the minimalist way, but for the content this blog cares about, this is the key.


## Why this blog?

Let's be honest, my writing is not that great. It takes me forever to write something that is half decent. I had many examples of trying and failing to communicate ideas and proposals that got misunderstood and that frustrated me. A lot. But then I decided to work on it. Practice, learn, rince and improve.

### Because "A writer writes"

I need to put the hours to learn the craft. To do that, I want to write about things I do care about. I'll create a few other blogs, but my schedule don't make it easy to find the time to do research on multiple topics in order to write articles.

this is about practicing writing and thinking with clarity. Doing it on a schedule, ship stuff. I wanted to practice and force me to "ship" stuff, whether they are read or not. To be precise, I don't think should read this blog. It is about how many hours you spend on it. Practice conveys and discuss complex ideas and opinion in a better way.


### Because I want to record my journey
Because it is hard to look back and see the struggles, the stuff that were hard to understand or hard to get right. If I want to help others with that some time in the future, I need to be aware of what was hard: think of the curse of knowledge.

### Because I want to check and deepen my understanding

Help me think better

And see if I can write clearly about somethin should help me understand well enough the topic.

Nothing clarifies your writing mind like the thought that someone else is going to read your work. You have to continually ask people what they think.

> If you can't write clearly, you probably don't think nearly as well as you think you do.
> -- Kurt Vonnegut (2008). “Armageddon in Retrospect”, p.8, Penguin

If he writes well, he will think well. 


## Here are the topics I think are part of the blog

This blog focus around non-fiction type of writing, like expository writing, persuasive writing, argumentative writing. But it is not just about final product, it is about the process and tools that help you getting it.

I want to write about what I learned, the insights, the failures.


- Writing tools
- Writing workflow
- Critical thinking
- Express yourself clearly
- Knowledge work
- Editing
- Learning
- Practicing
- Better thinking
- Habits
- Motivation
- Self improvement
- Note taking
- book writing

I plan to start a few other blogs writing about other topics I care about. But I have few times, so I need to focus.


## Promise: I shall not write bullshit or be part of the echo chamber

An important question is how can you write a blog about something you don't know a lot about? 

One of the things I want to do is avoid writing a bullshit blog in which I try to appear as a knowledgable person, some of expert, giving bullshit advice about stuff he doesn't really know about, solely repeating what other have said. I think this is an interesting topic and I'll write an article about it.

I shall check facts. Identify proposition, even if they are common and make sure they are backed up by more than mindless repetition of the same idea.

I will never pretend to know something unless I am convinced I know in depth

I shall just report of what I learned

I'll make sure the accidental read is not misled by stating clearly that this essay are mere practice and that I am not an expert or a reference in the domain.

Warning: I am not an expert, I write this blog to help me clarify my understanding. Read here about why you shouldn't read this blog, even if your life depended on it.


## There is nothing for a reader here... yet

To be honest, I don't think anybody should read this blog yet.  I don't write will yet, I don't have deep experience to share or recommendations to do. I just lack the experience and the mastery. But it will come, at some point in the future. Maybe I'll be able to look back at this. 


This blog is, first of all, my practice ground, but putting something outside means a lot to me. It is about getting stuff done, shipped, outputed. Getting something out makes it more meaningful.

Write with clarity is not just a goal, it is also an injunction: "write with clarity!". This is a craft that anybody should master, especially on this world becoming more "remote": communicating complex ideas in writing is super important. But not just that, stating your opinion


It is also about making it fun and making enjoy reading your stuff. Reading should be interesting, maybe not always fun, put at least people want to read it, and at the end, they will have a clear understanding of what you meant to say, they will have acquired knowledge, they will have changed.

Don't take any of my "advice", I hope I am not going to give any by mistakes. Anyway, there should be no advice, just personal experience.

Idea:
* to competition about the best way to explain something in x words?
* reread and edit other people articles?
